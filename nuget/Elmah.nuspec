    <description>ELMAH with initial configuration for getting started quickly. ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment.</description>

    <releaseNotes>This release updates the way that the elmah.axd httpHandler is registered in web.config.
The handler is now registered in a &lt;location path="elmah.axd" /&gt; element which makes it much more secure.
Furthermore, an &lt;authorization /&gt; element is placed on the location such that only users with a role of elmah are able to view the handler. 
There are compelling reasons for doing this which are documented here: http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html
Additional information can be found on the project's wiki page: http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/SecuringErrorLogPages
Also, don't forget to look at App_Readme\Elmah.txt in your application's root folder.</releaseNotes>
